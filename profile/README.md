# ℹ️ About

**Klydra** is an independent, completely open-source [Linux](https://kernel.org) distribution.

**Klydra** is:

- 🤝 **Open Source** — anyone can see and modify the code (of course, changes are subject to approval 😉).
- ✌️ **Free** — not just free of cost, but also giving users true freedom through open source.
- 🔄 **Multi-release** — what does this mean? You get both a rolling release, where software is always up to date with the newest versions, and a stable release, where software is frozen at a specific, well-tested version.
- 🍀 **Lightweight and optimized** — it takes very little storage and runs fast!
- 📃 **Written from scratch** — making it different from any other distro.
